Details: Download Google USB drivers to connect Nexus Android device with a Windows PC. This is an optional utility provided by Google which you can use when ADB debugging your Android app on a Nexus device. These drivers are also included in the Android SDK Manager when you set up Android Studio on your computer. However, Google still allows users to manually download the latest iteration of their USB drivers directly from them. Not just for Google Nexus devices, these USB drivers are universal to most Android devices and may be compatible with all — you will have to give them a try.
